# Pandas
Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. This library is built on top of the NumPy library. Pandas is fast and it has high performance & productivity for users.

## Advantages 
Fast and efficient for manipulating and analyzing data.
Data from different file objects can be loaded.
Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
Data set merging and joining.
Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
Provides time-series functionality.
Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.

After the pandas have been installed into the system, you need to import the library. This module is generally imported as:
*-->* `import pandas as pd`

Here, pd is referred to as an alias to the Pandas. However, it is not necessary to import the library using the alias, it just helps in writing less amount code every time a method or property is called. 

Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are: 

- Series
- DataFrame
