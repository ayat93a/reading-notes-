# Web Scraping

- Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

- Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
- Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

## Important notes about web scraping:
- Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

### How to Scrape Websites Without Getting Blocked
- Web scraping is a task that has to be performed responsibly so that it does not have a detrimental effect on the sites being scraped.
- bad scraping practices can have some impact on the performance of the site. While most websites may not have anti-scraping mechanisms, some sites use measures that can lead to web scraping getting blocked, because they do not believe in open data access.
