# How To Run Linear Regressions In Python Scikit-Learn

*Scikit-learn is a Python package that simplifies the implementation of a wide range of Machine Learning (ML) methods for predictive data analysis, including linear regression.*

- Linear regression can be thought of as finding the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points , You can then project that line to predict new data points. Linear regression is a fundamental ML algorithm due to its comparatively simple and core properties.

## Linear Regression Concepts
A basic understanding of statistical math is key to comprehending linear regression, as is a good grounding in ML concepts.


### The following are some key concepts you will come across when you work with scikit-learn’s linear regression method:
- Best Fit – the straight line in a plot that minimizes the deviation between related scattered data points.
- Coefficient – also known as a parameter, is the factor a variable is multiplied by. In linear regression, a coefficient represents changes in a Response Variable (see below).
- Coefficient of Determination – the correlation coefficient denoted as 𝑅². Used to describe the precision or degree of fit in a regression. 
- Correlation – the relationship between two variables in terms of quantifiable strength and degree, often referred to as the ‘degree of correlation’.  Values range between -1.0 and 1.0. 
- Dependent Feature – a variable denoted as y in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Output, or a Response. 
- Estimated Regression Line – the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points.
- Independent Feature – a variable denoted as x in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Input, or a predictor. 
- Intercept – the location where the Slope intercepts the Y-axis denoted b in the slope equation y=ax+b. 
- Least Squares – a method of estimating a Best Fit to data, by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and estimated values.
- Mean – an average of a set of numbers, but in linear regression, Mean is modeled by a linear function.
- Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) – more commonly known as Linear Regression. 
- Residual – vertical distance between a data point and the line of regression (see Residual in Figure 1 below).
- Regression – estimate of predictive change in a variable in relation to changes in other variables (see Predicted Response in Figure 1 below).
- Regression Model – the ideal formula for approximating a regression.
- Response Variables – includes both the Predicted Response (the value predicted by the regression) and the Actual Response, which is the actual value of the data point (see Figure 1 below).
- Slope – the steepness of a line of regression. Slope and Intercept can be used to define the linear relationship between two variables: y=ax+b.
- Simple Linear Regression – a linear regression that has a single independent variable.

### How to Create a Linear Regression Model
In this example, a linear regression model is created based on data in a numpy array.  :
```
# Import the packages and classes needed in this example:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a numpy array of data:
x = np.array([6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([4, 23, 10, 12, 22, 35])

# Create an instance of a linear regression model and fit it to the data with the fit() function:
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y) 

# The following section will get results by interpreting the created instance: 

# Obtain the coefficient of determination by calling the model with the score() function, then print the coefficient:
r_sq = model.score(x, y)
print('coefficient of determination:', r_sq)

# Print the Intercept:
print('intercept:', model.intercept_)

# Print the Slope:
print('slope:', model.coef_) 

# Predict a Response and print it:
y_pred = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted response:', y_pred, sep='\n')

```
